HCL to JSON
===========

This package uses GopherJS[1] to convert the tmccombs/hcl2json/convert[2]
Golang package into JavaScript and provide it as a CommonJS module. Currently
this uses the 0.3.1 due to breaking changes in the output between 0.3.1 and
0.3.2.

Build
-----

The current repository will need to be checked out into the $GOPATH for
the build to work (this is currently a requirement of GopherJS).

Then run:

    % make build

This will generate two files a hcltojson.js and an hcltojson.js.map with
source maps for the minified file.

The output file is ~3.9MB minified and ~700KB gzipped.

Usage
-----

The module exposes a single function `hcltojson()` this takes a string
of HCL2 and returns a JavaScript object:

    const { hcltojson } = require('./hcltojson');
    const tf = fs.readFileSync('../path/to/terraform.tf', 'utf-8');
    const data = hcltojson(tf);

Test
----

A simple assertion that the compiled file works can be run via:

    % make test

This will check the parsed result of the example.tf function matches the
content of fixture.json.

TODO
----

1. Support the latest 0.3.2 version of hcl2json.
